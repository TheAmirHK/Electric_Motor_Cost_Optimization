In this work, a comprehensive approach to tolerance allocation that takes into account production strategies and component functional fulfillment is proposed. A statistical framework is developed to analyze resource allocation and reworking decisions in assembly design. The framework incorporates a simulation and surrogate approach to assess product performance, enabling the study of deviations in components' geometries and the application of production strategies. A modular costing system is developed, and a genetic algorithm is implemented to identify optimal solutions.</p>
